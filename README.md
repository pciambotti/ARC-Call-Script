Call Script for Agent Call Handling

This is intended to be a script for agents to follow as they receive calls.
Via javascript, the agent is able to navigate through the flow of the script. There is both javascript and .Net validation on the page to ensure the page is submitted properly.
Working with agents, they break anything. Thus the dual validation.
